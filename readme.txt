Little Free Archive Freshener is a helpful dashboard widget that prompts you to update your archives, one post or page at a time.


== Description ==

Visitors and search engines prefer websites that are up to date! Little Free Archive Freshener helps you keep posts and pages on your website up to date by prompting you to update and improve them, one at a time.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where can I find the options? =

You can find the options in your WordPress dashboard under **Settings** / **Writing**, towards the bottom of the page.


= How does Little Free Archive Freshener decide which posts or pages need an update? =

It's pretty simple, actually. Little Free Archive Freshener randomly selects a post or page that is older than 90 days. The selected post or page is shown until you update it, or until tomorrow, whichever comes first. If you update it, Little Free Archive Freshener will select another one.

You can change the number of days in the options, next to **Freshen After**. If a post has been updated more recently than the number of days you enter, it will not be included in the post query.

You can also change the post types included in the query. By default, Little Free Archive Freshener selects from posts and pages. But other themes and plugins may have added other post types. For example, WooCommerce adds a *product* post type. In the options, next to **Include Post Types**, check the boxes next to any post types you want to keep updated.


= What does "skip for now" do when I click it? =

You can click **skip now** to skip a post—for now—and get a new suggestion. It goes right back into the pool. (There is a chance it will be selected again, of course, especially if you don't have many posts.)


= What does "ignore forever" do when I click it? =

If you click **ignore forever**, the post is added to a list of posts that are excluded from Little Free Archive Freshener's query when it goes to fetch a post that needs updating. You will also get a new suggestion.

You can clear the list of ignored posts in the options, next to **Clear Ignored Posts**.
